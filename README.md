## Below are the features of MasteryKarate website

* User Authentication: The project includes a robust user authentication system that allows users to register, login, and securely access their accounts. It ensures that only authenticated users can access specific pages and perform actions based on their roles (student, instructor, admin).
* Class Selection and Enrollment: Users can browse through the available classes, view class details such as instructor name, available seats, and price, and select classes of their interest. Once selected, users can proceed to enroll in those classes, make payments, and track their enrolled classes.
* Instructor Management: Instructors have dedicated functionality to add classes, manage class details (such as name, image, available seats, price), and track the total number of enrolled students. They can also receive feedback from the admin and update class information accordingly.
* Admin Controls and Class Management: The admin has comprehensive controls over the system, including the ability to approve or deny class requests, send feedback to instructors, manage user roles, and oversee the overall functioning of the platform. The admin dashboard provides a centralized interface for efficient class and user management.
* Payment Processing and History: The project integrates a payment processing system that allows users to securely make payments for their selected classes. It also maintains a payment history page where users can view their past payment transactions, providing transparency and record-keeping.
